# ml-intro-notebook
A self-paced introduction to building a simple ML classifier, evaluating it, and applying it to new data.

This repo contains some introductory ML teaching resources that build on materials I developed with Lukas Biewald 
(see github.com/lukas/ml-class). The most
significant difference is that here, the entire lesson (save a bit of explanatory content) is included within a single
self-paced Jupyter notebook. Participants actually write their own code, but the notebook contains enough examples to get
started pretty easily and extensive documentation in markdown to guide users through the exercise.

I originally developed this as a resource for an educational hackathon so some of the language in the notebook still reflects
that. However, this should be fun and useful for individuals as well.

At some point in the future I will include some slides to provide some more introduction and flesh out a couple more advanced
concepts (you'll see a couple break points in the notebook that correspond to these discussions -- the first is about Bayes's
Theorem, and the second is about cross-validation and confusion matrices). Good explanations of these concepts are readily
available elsewhere in the interim.

This exercise makes use of Jupyter, Python, numpy, scikit-learn, and pyplot in its current form. If you don't have those,
the easiest thing to do by far will be to install Anaconda which bundles them and lots of other useful stuff all together.
